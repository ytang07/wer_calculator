So for you I guess you moved on really easily. You found a new girl and it only took a couple of weeks. Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world for you? I guess that you've been working on yourself. I guess a therapist I found for you she really helped. Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl. Are happy? Help me for you. I guess you're getting everything you want. You call a new car and your career really know like we never even happened, baby, tell me what is up with that? And API's like you never even let me remember when you swear to God I was the only person who I forgot. You will throw that through you. You will never have to head the way you know that I do. Yeah, I don't. Ooooooooooo no opposes like wounding salts. Maybe I'm too emotional maybe you never get it all maybe I'm too emotional. You opposes like wounding salt. Maybe I'm too emotional maybe you never get it all happy and healthy. Not if you ever get to go for your so for you. I guess you must believe.
