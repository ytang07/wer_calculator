We hug and, yes, we make love
And always just say, "Goodnight" (la-la-la, la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothing to lose, uh-oh
(It's just principle)
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you move, uh-oh
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la, la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (la-la-la, la-la)
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la, la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (la-la-la, la-la)
I, I feel like fucking something
But we can be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy-dummy
I like to say, "What if?"
But if we could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might be on to something
I ain't giving you one in public
I'm giving you hundreds, fuck it
Something we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last, on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishing that the pussy was a kissing booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin, and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip-gloss, hickeys too, huh
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothing to lose, uh-oh
(It's just principle)
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you move, uh-oh
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la, la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (la-la-la, la-la)
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la, la-la
All on my tongue, I want it
Say, give me a buck, need that gushy stuff
Push your limit, no, you ain't good enough
All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fucking with you feel like jail, nigga
I can't even exhale, nigga
Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dipping with your friend
You ain't even half man, lying on your-, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real (all this ass)
Drama make you feel (make you feel)
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothing to lose, uh-oh
(It's just principle)
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you groove, uh-oh
Oh, darling
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Ooh, I love the taste, oh-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it
